In\ncontemporary research, there has been a notable upsurge in exploring feature\nextraction through random sampling. Unlike deep convolutional networks, these\nmethods sidestep elaborate training procedures, yet they often necessitate\ngenerating a surplus of features to comprehensively encapsulate time series\nnuances. Consequently, some features may lack relevance to labels or exhibit\nmulti-collinearity with others. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical\nfeature selection method aided by ANOVA variance analysis to address this\nchallenge. Through meticulous experimentation, we demonstrate that our method\nsubstantially reduces features by over 94% while preserving accuracy -- a\nsignificant advancement in the field of time series analysis and feature\nselection.",

In practice, however, all communication links\nare affected by noise from the environment. Here we investigate the ability of\nquantum channels to perform quantum communication tasks by restricting the\nparticipants to use only local operations and one-way classical communication\n(one-way LOCC) along with the available quantum channel. In particular, a\nchannel can be used to distill a highly entangled state between two parties,\nwhich further enables quantum or private communication. In this work, we invoke\nthe framework of superchannels to study the distillation of a resourceful\nquantum state, such as a maximally entangled state or a private state, using\nmultiple instances of a point-to-point quantum channel. We use the idea of\n$k$-extendibility to obtain a semidefinite relaxation of the set of one-way\nLOCC superchannels and define a class of entanglement measures for quantum\nchannels that decrease monotonically under such superchannels; therefore these\nmeasures, dubbed collectively the ``unextendible entanglement of a channel'',\nyield upper bounds on several communication-theoretic quantities of interest in\nthe regimes of resource distillation and zero error. We then generalize the\nformalism of $k$-extendibility to bipartite superchannels, thus obtaining\nfunctions that are monotone under two-extendible superchannels. This allows us\nto analyze probabilistic distillation of ebits or secret key bits from a\nbipartite state when using a resourceful quantum channel.

These costs can present\nchallenges, particularly in indoor dense spaces (IDSs). A self-sustainable\nmetasurface (SSM), which retains reconfigurability unlike a static metasurface\n(SMS), achieves a lower operating cost than a reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS) by being self-sustainable through power harvesting. In this\npaper, in order to find a better trade-off between metasurface gain, coverage,\nand operating cost, the design and performance of an SSM-assisted indoor mmWave\ncommunication system are investigated. We first simplify the design of the\nSSM-assisted system by considering the use of SSMs in a preset-based manner and\nthe formation of coverage groups by associating SSMs with the closest user\nequipments (UEs). We propose a two-stage iterative algorithm to maximize the\nminimum data rate in the system by jointly deciding the association between the\nUEs and the SSMs, the phase-shifts of the SSMs, and allocating time resources\nfor each UE. The non-convexities that exist in the proposed optimization\nproblem are tackled using the feasible point pursuit successive convex\napproximation method and the concave-convex procedure. To understand the best\nscenario for using SSM, the resulting performance is compared with that\nachieved with RIS and SMS.

In\nparticular, for many FL algorithms, the convergence rate grows dramatically\nwhen the number of local updates becomes large, especially when the product of\nthe gradient divergence and local Lipschitz constant is large. However,\nempirical studies can show that more local updates can improve the convergence\nrate even when these two parameters are large, which is inconsistent with the\ntheoretical findings. This paper aims to bridge this gap between theoretical\nunderstanding and practical performance by providing a theoretical analysis\nfrom a new perspective on data heterogeneity. In particular, we propose a new\nand weaker assumption compared to the local Lipschitz gradient assumption,\nnamed the heterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz assumption. We show that this\nand the gradient divergence assumptions can jointly characterize the effect of\ndata heterogeneity. By deriving a convergence upper bound for FedAvg and its\nextensions, we show that, compared to the existing works, local Lipschitz\nconstant is replaced by the much smaller heterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz\nconstant and the corresponding convergence upper bound can be significantly\nreduced for the same number of local updates, although its order stays the\nsame. In addition, when the local objective function is quadratic, more\ninsights on the impact of data heterogeneity can be obtained using the\nheterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz constant.

In this letter, we introduce an innovative SIM-aided semantic\ncommunication system for image recognition tasks. In the considered model, a\nSIM is positioned in front of the transmitting antenna. In contrast to\nconventional communication systems transmitting the modulated signals carrying\nthe image information or compressed semantic information, the carrier\nelectromagnetic (EM) wave is directly transmitted from the source in the\nproposed system. The input layer of the SIM is utilized for source encoding,\nwhile the remaining multi-layer architecture constitutes a DNN for semantic\nencoding. Specifically, the semantic encoder aims to transform the signals\npassing through the input layer of the SIM into a unique beam towards a\nreceiving antenna corresponding to the image class. Remarkably, both the source\nand semantic encoding occur naturally as the EM waves propagate through the\nSIM. At the receiver, the image is recognized by probing the received signal\nmagnitude across the receiving array. To this end, we develop an efficient\nalgorithm to train the transmission coefficients of SIM's meta-atoms to learn\nthe semantic representation of the image.

We also extend our analysis to the more\ncomplicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter\nand efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the\nuse of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel\nexclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of\nmultivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence.\nMoreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important\nspecial cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound\nprovides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error\nexponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special\ncase of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a\nnonadaptive strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical\nchannel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary\nclassical channel discrimination.",

We develop a new data-driven approach for UQ in regression\nthat applies both to classical regression approaches such as the LASSO as well\nas to neural networks. One of the most notable UQ techniques is the debiased\nLASSO, which modifies the LASSO to allow for the construction of asymptotic\nconfidence intervals by decomposing the estimation error into a Gaussian and an\nasymptotically vanishing bias component. However, in real-world problems with\nfinite-dimensional data, the bias term is often too significant to be\nneglected, resulting in overly narrow confidence intervals. Our work rigorously\naddresses this issue and derives a data-driven adjustment that corrects the\nconfidence intervals for a large class of predictors by estimating the means\nand variances of the bias terms from training data, exploiting high-dimensional\nconcentration phenomena. This gives rise to non-asymptotic confidence\nintervals, which can help avoid overestimating uncertainty in critical\napplications such as MRI diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis extends beyond\nsparse regression to data-driven predictors like neural networks, enhancing the\nreliability of model-based deep learning. Our findings bridge the gap between\nestablished theory and the practical applicability of such debiased methods.",

Thus, uncertainty quantification (UQ) can be\nperformed exploiting the Gaussian model.

This, in turn, can downgrade the advantage of\nthe UQ methods as compared to non-UQ approaches such as the standard LASSO. In\nthis paper, we present a method to improve the debiased estimator by sampling\nwithout replacement. Our approach leverages recent results of ours on the\nstructure of the random nature of certain sampling schemes showing how a\ntransition between sampling with and without replacement can lead to a weighted\nreconstruction scheme with improved performance for the standard LASSO.

In this paper, we explore the beam focusing-based physical layer\nsecurity (PLS) in the near field, where multiple legitimate users and one\neavesdropper are situated in the near-field region of the XL-array base station\n(BS). First, we consider a special case with one legitimate user and one\neavesdropper to shed useful insights into near-field PLS. In particular, it is\nshown that 1) Artificial noise (AN) is crucial to near-field security\nprovisioning, transforming an insecure system to a secure one; 2) AN can yield\nnumerous security gains, which considerably enhances PLS in the near field as\ncompared to the case without AN taken into account. Next, for the general case\nwith multiple legitimate users, we propose an efficient low-complexity approach\nto design the beamforming with AN to guarantee near-field secure transmission.\nSpecifically, the low-complexity approach is conceived starting by introducing\nthe concept of interference domain to capture the inter-user interference\nlevel, followed by a three-step identification framework for designing the\nbeamforming.

Here, we put in context these new EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT\nconcepts by connecting them to the DDT for a differentially $\\delta$-uniform\nfunction and also determine the EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT entries of three classes\nof differentially $4$-uniform power permutations, namely, Gold, Kasami and\nBracken-Leander. We also determine the Double Boomerang Connectivity Table\n(DBCT) entries of the Gold function. As byproducts of our approach, we obtain\nsome previously published results quite easily.",

However, the increased antenna aperture size extends the range of\nthe Fresnel region, leading to a hybrid near-far field communication mode. The\nusers and scatterers randomly lie in near-field and far-field zones, and thus,\nconventional far-field-only and near-field-only channel estimation methods may\nnot work. To tackle this challenge, we demonstrate the existence of the power\ndiffusion (PD) effect, which leads to a mismatch between the hybrid-field\nchannel and existing channel estimation methods. Specifically, in far-field and\nnear-field transform domains, the power gain of one channel path may diffuse to\nother positions, thus generating fake paths. This renders the conventional\ntechniques unable to detect those real paths. We propose a PD-aware orthogonal\nmatching pursuit algorithm to eliminate the influence of the PD effect by\nidentifying the PD range within which paths diffuse to other positions. PD-OMP\nfits a general case without prior knowledge of near-field and far-field path\nnumbers and the user's location.

        "summary": "Index modulation (IM) significantly enhances the spectral efficiency of fluid\nantennas (FAs) enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is\nnamed FA-IM. However, due to the dense distribution of ports on fluid antennas,\nthe wireless channel exhibits a high spatial correlation, resulting in severe\nperformance degradation in the existing FA-IM scheme. This paper proposes a\nnovel fluid antenna grouping index modulation (FA-GIM) scheme to mitigate the\nspatial correlation of the FA-IM channel, further enhancing system performance.\nBased on the spatial correlation model of two-dimensional (2D) fluid antenna\nsurfaces, this paper specifically adopts a block grouping method where adjacent\nports are allocated to the same group. The numerical results demonstrate that\nthe proposed scheme exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared\nto the state-of-the-art scheme, enhancing the robustness of FA-assisted MIMO\nsystems.",

        "summary": "Resilience and power consumption are two important performance metrics for\nmany modern communication systems, and it is therefore important to define,\nanalyze, and optimize them. In this work, we consider a wireless communication\nsystem with secret-key generation, in which the secret-key bits are added to\nand used from a pool of available key bits. We propose novel physical layer\nresilience metrics for the survivability of such systems. In addition, we\npropose multiple power allocation schemes and analyze their trade-off between\nresilience and power consumption. In particular, we investigate and compare\nconstant power allocation, an adaptive analytical algorithm, and a\nreinforcement learning-based solution. It is shown how the transmit power can\nbe minimized such that a specified resilience is guaranteed. These results can\nbe used directly by designers of such systems to optimize the system parameters\nfor the desired performance in terms of reliability, security, and resilience.",

        "summary": "A conflict-avoiding code (CAC) is a deterministic transmission scheme for\nasynchronous multiple access without feedback. When the number of\nsimultaneously active users is less than or equal to $w$, a CAC of length $L$\nwith weight $w$ can provide a hard guarantee that each active user has at least\none successful transmission within every consecutive $L$ slots. In this paper,\nwe generalize some previously known constructions of constant-weight CACs, and\nthen derive several classes of optimal CACs by the help of Kneser's Theorem and\nsome techniques in Additive Combinatorics. Another spotlight of this paper is\nto relax the identical-weight constraint in prior studies to study mixed-weight\nCACs for the first time, for the purpose of increasing the throughput and\nreducing the access delay of some potential users with higher priority. As\napplications of those obtained optimal CACs, we derive some classes of optimal\nmixed-weight CACs.",
